# Chrome-Extension
a chrome extension I made as a school project.

To use this, click the green code button and select download as zip. unzip the folder and  then go to chrome://extensions. on the top right, you can enable developer mode. when you do this, several buttons should pop up. select "load unpacked" and select the folder from earlier.
this wont work on mobile
